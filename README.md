# ThousandPlayer
A Qt6-based open-source audio player developed from scratch. It is a tribute to [TTPlayer（千千静听）](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/千千音乐播放器),
one of the most popular local audio players for Microsoft Windows in China during 2000s.

The software is still in early development stage,
but already has the fundamental functions that a local audio player should have. Feel free to paticipate in the development!

## Features
- Cross-platform support.
  - Linux and Microsoft Windows 10 are supported at present. Need other developers' help to check the availability in macOS.
- Internationalization support.
  - Most UI elements have text with proper font sizes instead of icon-only for the sake of localizability.
  - Current supported languages are:
    - English
    - 简体中文
    - 繁體中文
    - 日本語
- A horizontally expandable main window. No need to worry about long music informations.
- A cover viewer for viewing album covers.
- Rich finding and sorting.
- ReplayGain support.

## Future planning
